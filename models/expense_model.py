"""MODEL: operating expense tracking used by the Reports & Analytics page.

There was no Expense table in the original schema (only product cost via
PurchaseOrderDetails), so this model self-migrates a small table on first
use -- the same pattern InventoryModel already uses for Product columns.
Existing databases pick this up automatically; nothing needs to be
re-installed.
